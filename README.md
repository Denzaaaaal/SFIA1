H2Brief
To create an application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training. The application must manipulate two tables with full CRUD functionality.

H3Solution
I have decided to create a online personal finance manager which allows the user to keep track of there income, expenses and investments. Due to the ammount of data an individual would generate within all 3 catagories a relational database would be extremely useful to drawing conclusions on where you are wasting money.
